<h1>Positive Selection Signals Database (PSSDB)</h1>
Harmonized signals of recent positive selection across multiple species, aggregated from peer-reviewed studies. Browse by species, chromosome, genomic range, or gene; results include normalized coordinates, key metrics (Fst, XP-EHH, iHS, etc.), assembly context, and full provenance.

<h2>How to use</h2>
Filters are orthogonal. Use any subset of filters; anything you leave blank defaults to “all”. Selected filters are intersected.

<h3>1) Explore a species</h3>
Want the full picture for one species? Choose the species and run the search (you can leave chromosome, range, and gene empty).
You’ll get: all curated signals for that species — genes, SNPs and window-based hits merged from multiple studies — with normalized coordinates, key metrics (Fst, XP-EHH, iHS, etc.), assembly, populations (when applicable), and provenance. Use the visual panel below to spot notable regions at a glance.

<h3>2) Focus on a gene</h3>
Interested in a particular gene’s evolutionary story? Select the gene (optionally pick a species).
You’ll get: all selection signals overlapping that gene (and nearby SNPs/windows) in the chosen species. If you run this for different species, you can quickly see where the gene shows evidence of recent positive selection.

<h3>3) Investigate a genomic region</h3>
Curious about a specific locus? Pick a species, then set a chromosome and either a start–end range or leave the range empty to scan the whole chromosome.
You’ll get: every signal that falls inside the region — ideal for checking whether a candidate interval carries evidence of selection.

Notes

Coordinates are in base pairs, 1-based inclusive.

Leaving a field empty broadens scope (e.g., “species only” lists everything for that species).

Results always show the source study so you can trace every record back to the paper/supplement.

<h2>Summary & visualizations (species-level only)</h2>
Select a species and click Get summary to generate high-level views for the entire species dataset.
Note: chromosome/range/gene filters do not apply to this section.

What you’ll see now

Chromosome view: signal density and top windows mapped across chromosomes.

Enrichment analysis: over-representation of genes/pathways (e.g., GO/KEGG) with FDR correction.

Coming soon

Subset-aware summaries (by region/gene) and additional distributions (by metric and comparisons).

<h2>Contribute & keep PSSDB growing</h2>
PSSDB is community-driven and updated continuously. If you know a study that reports recent positive-selection signals, please submit it — the pipeline will handle the rest.

What to upload

The article PDF.

All supplementary files from the paper (tables/appendices) in their original formats (XLSX/CSV/TSV/DOCX/PDF/TXT).

What happens next

The ingestion pipeline extracts, normalizes, annotates, validates, and adds the signals to the database.

Records are linked to the paper’s DOI/PMID and include full provenance.

(Optional but helpful) Include the species and genome assembly if stated in the paper.
